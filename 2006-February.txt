Thanks for qjacktuner! I was casting about for a tuner that would work with jack and this one did on the first try. Wow, was my guitar ever out of whack...

When it can't pick up a solid 1st harmonic though qjackctl jitters quite a lot. I'm not sure what the cause of this is, but maybe ignoring samples that do not have a "sufficiently dominant" harmonic would do the trick.

Jitters aside, it worked. :) You should see if you can get qjacktuner into demudi / planet ccrma--that would bring it to a much wider audience.

m.f.g.
